## Bugs found by review (2026-03-27)

- [x] `char_to_glyph_id` hardcodes face 0 — outline.rs:191 uses
  `FontRef::new(font_data)` while outline.rs:165 correctly takes face_index
  and calls `from_index`. For TTC collections, glyph mapping can come from a
  different face than the outline/metrics path.

- [x] Empty outlines produce invalid bounds — prepare.rs:28 and prepare.rs:79
  return `[f32::MAX, f32::MAX, f32::MIN, f32::MIN]` when curves are empty.
  The main path avoids this (outline.rs:180 returns None for empty pens), but
  the invariant is not enforced at the API boundary. Direct callers of
  `prepare_outline` or `apply_italic_shear` can produce nonsensical bounds.

- [ ] Variation handling is narrow — text_renderer.rs synthesizes only a `wght`
  axis from `glyph.font_weight`. Arbitrary variation coordinates from
  cosmic-text are not propagated. Fonts with width, slant, optical size, or
  custom axes will render with default values.

- [ ] Glyph cache key doesn't cover full variation space — glyph_cache.rs keys
  on font_id, glyph_id, weight, and cache_key_flags. Two glyphs that differ
  only in a non-weight variation axis will hash to the same entry.

- [ ] Cubic-to-quadratic subdivision may be too shallow — outline.rs uses
  recursive conversion with MAX_DEPTH = 3 and a simple error heuristic.
  CFF-heavy fonts with complex cubic outlines may produce visible
  approximation errors.

- [ ] `prepare_with_depth` does too much — text_renderer.rs:57 handles font
  lookup, TTC face resolution, variation setup, outline extraction, fake
  italic, cache insertion, non-vector classification, instance packing, and
  vertex upload. Renderer and atlas are tightly coupled through pub(crate)
  internals.

- [ ] Dead API surface — `RenderError` variants `RemovedFromAtlas` and
  `ScreenResolutionChanged` are public but `render()` always returns
  `Ok(())`. `SwashCache` and `CommandEncoder` are in the compatibility
  signature but unused.

- [ ] Emoji classification should be an explicit API — non-vector glyphs are
  currently a sentinel `GlyphEntry` in glyph_cache.rs:53, skipped as a side
  effect of prepare(). For clean two-pass routing (sluggrs + cryoglyph
  fallback), classification needs to be a separate step, not incidental to
  prepare(). **arch review**: the silent drop with no error/placeholder/signal
  to iced violates the integration contract — users see missing characters
  in otherwise normal text with no indication anything is wrong.

- [x] `fwidth()` can return zero at quad edges → NaN propagation — in
  simple_shader.wgsl, `pixels_per_em = 1.0 / fwidth(render_coord)` produces
  infinity at helper lane boundaries. When a root lands at exactly 0.0,
  `0.0 * infinity = NaN`. WGSL spec says `clamp` with NaN returns
  "implementation-defined value from the range" — NVIDIA returns 0, AMD
  varies, Intel/Apple have their own behavior. The 1px dilation pushes most
  affected fragments outside the visible area but doesn't eliminate them.
  Result: vendor-specific 1px garbage fringe around glyphs. **gpu review**

- [x] Solver threshold 0.5 is too high — the linear fallback threshold in
  `solve_horiz_poly`/`solve_vert_poly` was raised from reference's ~1/65536
  to 0.5 to handle perturbed line segments. At 0.5, genuine quadratics with
  modest curvature (a.y = 0.3) enter the linear path where `0.5 / b.y` with
  small b.y produces garbage roots that feed into winding accumulation.
  Perturbed lines need a higher threshold than 1/65536 but 0.5 sweeps in
  real curves the linear path wasn't designed for. **slug review**

- [ ] Signed/unsigned confusion in shader texture addressing — the shader
  casts `vec2<u32>` to `vec2<i32>` for textureLoad coordinates, and uses
  arithmetic right shift on signed `i32` for row calculation. If band_loc.x
  goes negative (from offset addition wrapping or a bug), the arithmetic
  shift propagates the sign bit, corrupting row calculation with a silent
  wrong-texel read. Works today because numbers are small, but no safety
  margin or validation. **wgpu review**

- [ ] No atlas cache/texture sync validation — once a `GlyphEntry` is
  cached, the renderer trusts its band_offset, band_max, band_transform,
  and bounds indefinitely. No generation check, no version stamp, no
  cross-check after texture growth or reset. If the invariant breaks, the
  failure is silent misrendering, not a clean error. **bugs review**

- [ ] Hardcoded atlas texture formats with no capability probing —
  Rgba32Float (curves) and Rgba32Uint (bands) are used with no fallback
  path and no format abstraction. May not be portable across Metal, GLES,
  WebGPU, or downlevel configurations. **wgpu review**

## Before shipping

- [ ] Non-vector glyph fallback — color emoji and bitmap-only fonts currently
  produce no output. Required before the iced swap ships.

  **Dual-render-all spike failed** (repos/iced branch): rendering all text
  through both sluggrs and cryoglyph produces 1-2px vertical offset between
  the two renderers at small sizes (different rounding strategies for em-space
  vs pixel-snapped positioning). Not shippable.

  **Next approach: selective routing.** Requires glyph-level or run-segment-level
  partitioning so cryoglyph only renders non-vector glyphs. The hard part is
  constructing fallback-only draw inputs without disturbing text.rs's batching
  model — preserving layout positions, glyph advances, and run boundaries while
  routing only specific glyphs to cryoglyph. Likely needs a classification API
  from sluggrs and a two-pass approach in text.rs. See spike plan in
  .plans/effervescent-chasing-metcalfe.md for full context.
- [x] Trim/eviction — per-frame usage tracking via glyphs_in_use HashSet.
  Pressure-based reset when <50% of cached glyphs are in use (threshold 256).
  Matches cryoglyph frame-boundary semantics.
- [x] Depth plumbing — prepare_with_depth accepts the callback but discards
  the depth value (`_depth` at text_renderer.rs:232), and the vertex shader
  hardcodes `z = 0.0`. All glyphs render at the same depth. When iced uses
  depth-stencil for widget layering, overlapping text (tooltips, dropdowns,
  modals over text) will z-fight or bleed through. Won't show up in simple
  apps — manifests only when two text-bearing widgets overlap at different
  depths. Fix: pack depth into GlyphInstance, thread to shader, write to
  output.position.z. **bugs review**

## Optimization — CPU allocation reduction

Baseline: 92 glyphs, cold_prepare 1.9ms, warm_prepare 0.7ms, 9.7 MB total alloc.

### Done

- [x] Eliminate band_texels + add atlas scratch buffers — scratch_curve_texels and
  scratch_curve_locations on TextAtlas, band_texels eliminated via bytemuck::cast_slice.
  Result: upload_glyph alloc -37.5%, timing -23.8%.

- [x] Persist units_per_em_cache on TextRenderer — HashMap moved from local to field.
  Result: prepare_with_depth alloc -33.3%.

- [x] Cheap capacity fixes in build_bands — inner vectors pre-sized with heuristic,
  offset vectors and entries with exact capacity. Result: build_bands alloc -43.3%.

- [x] Pre-compute band sort keys + sort_unstable_by — avoids redundant max() in
  comparators, avoids sort temp allocation. Minimal timing impact (sort is cheap
  at 3-8 elements/band), but cleaner code.

Cumulative: 9.7 MB → 9.1 MB total alloc (-6.2%).

The remaining 8.5 MB is dominated by cosmic_text shaping, wgpu buffer management,
and font system internals — areas outside our control. Further micro-allocation
cleanup in upload_glyph/build_bands/prepare_with_depth would be diminishing returns.

build_bands improving less in time (-18.5%) than allocation (-43.3%) confirms it is
partly compute/sort bound (per-band sorting in band.rs), not just allocator bound.

### Parked — pursue only if profiling points here again

- [ ] Band builder algorithmic work — build_bands is partly compute-bound. Targets:
  - Temporary data layout: Vec<Vec<usize>> has poor locality; flat layout may help.
    **perf review**: this is 8-24 heap allocations per cache-miss glyph (one inner
    Vec per band), completely unsalvageable — built, sorted, iterated, dropped.
    Raising band counts doubles allocator pressure. Fix: single flat Vec<usize>
    with offset/length slicing (two-pass: count per band, then fill).
  - Reusable context: store scratch vectors on TextAtlas or BandBuilder struct.
    Requires API change (build_bands currently returns owned BandData).

- [ ] Color multiplication constant — replace `/ 255.0` with `* INV_255`. Cleanup
  win, not priority perf. Same for pre-computing default_color per text area.

## Optimization — GPU shader

### Profiling infrastructure (do first)

- [ ] Add wgpu-profiler to demo — wraps wgpu timestamp queries, outputs Chrome
  trace format. Gives per-frame GPU time for the text render pass. Currently we
  only measure CPU-side prep, not actual shader execution cost. Requires
  `Features::TIMESTAMP_QUERY` + `Features::TIMESTAMP_QUERY_INSIDE_PASSES`.

- [ ] RenderDoc inspection — capture a frame via Vulkan backend
  (`WGPU_BACKEND=vulkan`), verify early-exit is triggering, check per-pixel
  loop iteration counts. The `renderdoc` crate provides programmatic capture.

### Shader correctness / sync with reference

- [ ] Diff against Slug reference — our shaders were originally translated from
  the Slug HLSL reference (github.com/EricLengyel/Slug, MIT). Check for any
  upstream changes since our translation. Key areas:
  - CalcRootCode: reference uses bitwise sign extraction (`asuint(y) >> 31`)
    which reduces to a single LOP3 on NVIDIA. Ours uses `select()`. Verify
    naga produces equivalent SPIR-V, or switch to bitcast if it doesn't.
  - Band split (dual-sort) was removed from reference — we never had it, good.
  - Supersampling was removed — we never had it, good.
  - Dilation: reference uses dynamic vertex-shader dilation via inverse
    Jacobian. We use fixed 1px expansion — compare quality and performance.

### Shader optimization targets

- [ ] Texture fetch audit — each curve costs 2 textureLoad (p12, p3) + 1 for
  band ref. With ~8 curves/band, that's ~24 fetches per ray direction. Our
  2-texels-per-curve layout is already optimal for RGBA32Float. Verify we're
  not doing redundant loads.

- [ ] Branch divergence assessment — the `if abs(a.y) < 0.5` branch in
  solve_horiz_poly causes warp divergence between linear and quadratic paths.
  **slug review** found this threshold is too high: at 0.5, genuine quadratics
  with modest curvature enter the linear path (see bugs section). The branch
  prediction assumption ("rare, only perturbed lines") may not hold.
  Confirm with Nsight or RGP if available.

- [ ] Band bounding-box pre-check — if a band's y-range doesn't intersect the
  current pixel (within half a pixel), skip the entire band loop. Could
  eliminate the band header textureLoad for edge pixels.

### Not worth pursuing

- Band split (dual-sort) — Lengyel removed it; hurts small text more than
  it helps large text. We never had it.
- Supersampling — removed from reference; dilation handles it.
- Compute shader rewrite — osor.io's wave-level approach is impressive but
  requires fundamentally different architecture (compute dispatch, tile-based
  curve caching). Not compatible with our render-pass integration.

## Future / long-term

- [ ] Unbounded retained memory — curve_data and band_data in TextAtlas
  (text_atlas.rs:39-40) grow with each uploaded glyph and are never compacted.
  This is intentional: they exist so texture growth can re-upload prior contents.
  Not a leak (memory is reachable and purposeful), but unbounded retained memory
  until eviction/compaction exists. Fix options: GPU texture-to-texture copy on
  growth, or LRU eviction that compacts the staging buffers.

- [ ] Store units_per_em on GlyphEntry — capture during atlas upload, eliminates the
  second get_font() call and skrifa re-parse entirely. Adds 4 bytes to GlyphEntry.

- [ ] Texture growth batching — if many glyphs are added in frame 1, the texture
  may grow multiple times sequentially. Each growth does a full re-upload of all
  accumulated texture data, so multiple growths in a single prepare() call
  produce O(n) full re-uploads. On a frame that loads a new script (CJK, Arabic)
  with 200+ new glyphs across growth boundaries, this is an unbounded stall.
  Predict final size from glyph count and pre-allocate once. **arch review**

- [ ] Band count heuristic tuning — currently 4/8/12 bands based on curve count
  thresholds (10/30). Profile whether different thresholds or continuous scaling
  improves shader early-exit rates.

## Polish

- [ ] naga_oil for shader dedup — share fragment shader code between
  simple_shader.wgsl and shader.wgsl via `#import`. Eliminates copy-paste
  divergence risk. Alternative: WESL (wesl-rs) is newer but less mature.
- [ ] Band texture width configurable rather than hardcoded 4096
- [ ] ColorMode handling (currently stubbed — Slug renders in linear space)
- [ ] Texture growth under heavy load — stress test with CJK, mixed fonts
